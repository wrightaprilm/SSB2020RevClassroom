== Students get coding either late in undergrad, or after they've been mucking around unproductively with data

The Graphical Modeling Framework
----

- What is a model?

The Graphical Modeling Framework
----
- What is a model?
  + A model uses mathematics to describe a process, or the behavior of a system
  + Important facets of the generating process of the data are written down as parameters

  + Important facets of the generating process of the data are written down as parameters

- A graphical model represents the relationships and dependencies between model paramters

A simple case
----

- An archer: Let's say the archer is a pretty good archer

A simple case 
----

```{r}
good_shots <- rnorm(n= 100, mean= 0, sd = 1)
hist(good_shots, main="Archer arrow shots",  xlab = "Inches from bullseye")
```



A simple case

- An archer: Let's say the archer is a pretty bad archer

A simple case
----
```{r}
bad_shots <- rnorm(n= 100, mean= 0, sd = 5)
hist(bad_shots, main="Archer arrow shots",  xlab = "Inches from bullseye")
```

A **not so** simple case
----

> - It's easy to describe a model where we are manipulating one parameter 

> - But we rarely have such a simple case when we're analysing biological data 

> - We're describing the mechanisms that generated our observed data 

  + In the case of a tree, this is the process of molecular or morphological evolution

Who cares about graphical modeling?

> - In previous iterations of software, you might have to email a developer and ask them to implement something  

- RevBayes' graphical model framework emphasizes flexibility

Over the next two hours, we're going to make the case that this framework enables flexible, code-to-learn classrooms
